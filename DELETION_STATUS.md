# Message Deletion Status Report

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Telegram Deletion Detection**: The Pyrogram bot successfully detects when messages are deleted in Telegram
2. **Webhook System**: Deletion events are properly sent from the Python detector to the Node.js relay service
3. **Message Mapping**: The system correctly identifies which messages to delete across platforms
4. **Twitch Deletion**: Messages are successfully deleted from Twitch when deleted in Telegram
5. **Twitch Message Relay**: Messages from Discord are being properly relayed to Twitch (verified in logs)

### ❌ Issue with Discord
**The Discord bot cannot delete messages because it lacks the "Manage Messages" permission**

Error message in logs:
```
DiscordAPIError[50013]: Missing Permissions
```

## Solution Required

### You need to grant the Discord bot "Manage Messages" permission:

1. Go to your Discord server settings
2. Navigate to **Integrations** or **Members**
3. Find your bot (twitchrelayer)
4. Click on the bot and go to **Permissions**
5. Enable the **"Manage Messages"** permission
6. Save changes

## Test Results from Logs

When you delete a message in Telegram:
- ✅ Deletion detector captures it
- ✅ Webhook fires with mapping ID
- ✅ Relay manager processes deletion
- ✅ Twitch message gets deleted successfully
- ❌ Discord deletion fails with "Missing Permissions"

Example from your recent test:
```
Telegram message 11433 deleted → Webhook fired → Twitch deleted → Discord failed (no permission)
```

## Code Status
The code is working correctly. The enhanced error handling now clearly indicates when the bot lacks permissions. Once you grant the "Manage Messages" permission to your Discord bot, deletion synchronization will work for all platforms.

## Files Created
- `DISCORD_PERMISSIONS_FIX.md` - Detailed instructions for fixing permissions
- `DELETION_STATUS.md` - This status report

## Next Steps
1. Grant "Manage Messages" permission to the Discord bot
2. Test deletion again - it should work immediately after permission is granted
3. No code changes are required
